# VideoGame_Database
Video Game database final project for my databases course at the University of Chicago

The folder [final_project](./final_project) contains the source code for the website as well as the code to create and populate the database.
The folder [get_data](./get_data) contains code for grabbing the csv data from an online database and processing it for this specific use case.
