Final Project by Nesta Lenhert-Scholer

Python Version: 3.7


The search attribute that uses the wild card is the Game Name field. You can search for any notable game released
since 1994 (Tekken, Modern Warfare 2, Halo, Death Stranding, etc.).

Since there are about 50,000 games in the database,
some search results just based on the date and/or the genre might not show the game you are searching for if there are more
than 50 games that match that query. If this happens, use the name field to narrow down the search results.

I tested using a Chrome based browser, so functionality on another browser is not known.
